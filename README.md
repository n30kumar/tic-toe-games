Tic-Tac-Toe Games is a compact React + Vite project that demonstrates interactive game logic, component design, and responsive UI. Run the app locally with your preferred package manager and explore the simple, extendable codebase starting at src/App.jsx. Great as a learning project or a small playable demo.

Closing / Usage tips
Open src/App.jsx to see the main logic and state management. If you want, I can:
Convert the project to TypeScript,
Add unit tests for game logic,
Implement move history or AI opponent,
Or generate a polished README.md and a brief CONTRIBUTING guide.
